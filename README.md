## Date Created

## Description

This database holds data about a company that rents DVDs. Queries have been written to obtain a better
understanding of the data. An Entity-Relationship Diagram was used as guidance to join the different
entities of the database. Queries were written in order to answer the following questions: 

* What family-friendly movie categories are families watching most?
* What is the maximum, minimum and average rental duration of family-friendly movies?
* Which store has rented more movies in each month?
* What is the payment behavior of the top 10 customers?

The queried data was then downloaded as .csv files. Next, we have plot graphs about the data using
Microsoft Excel. Finally, we made a PowerPoint presentation in order to show our answers to the four
questions in a visual way.
